#- name: unique name of aggregated metric
#  operator: aggregation operator. Valid values are:
#             - "OR": counts unique elements that were observed triggering any of following events
#             - "AND": counts unique elements that were observed triggering all of following events
#  events: list of events names to aggregate into metric. All events in this list must have the same 'redis_slot' and 'aggregation' attributes
#           see from lib/gitlab/usage_data_counters/known_events/ for the list of valid events.
#  source: defines which datasource will be used to locate events that should be included in aggregated metric. Valid values are:
#          - database
#          - redis
#  time_frame: defines time frames for aggregated metrics:
#          - 7d - last 7 days
#          - 28d - last 28 days
#          - all - all historical available data, this time frame is not available for redis source
#  feature_flag: name of development feature flag that will be checked before metrics aggregation is performed.
#                Corresponding feature flag should have `default_enabled` attribute set to `false`.
#                This attribute is OPTIONAL and can be omitted, when `feature_flag` is missing no feature flag will be checked.
# Example:
#- name: product_analytics_test_metrics_intersection_database_sourced
#  source: database
#  time_frame: [28d]
#  events:
#    - 'dependency_scanning_pipeline'
#    - 'container_scanning_pipeline'
#  operator: AND
